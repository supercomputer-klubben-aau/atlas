#
# In this file, any line beginning with a '#' is ignored, but the # must be in
# column 0.  All multiple whitespace is reduced to one space (i.e. used only
# to distinguish where words begin/end).  Lines may be extended by putting '\'
# as the *last* character of line.
#
# This file indexes the user-supplied copy routines for the storage schemes
# indexed in storage.ids, and has the following format (non-mandatory
# keys show the default in []):
# ID=<id> STGID=<stgid> CBLK=[0,1] TOBLK=[0,1] TRANS=[0,1] CONJ=[0,1] \
#    MU=<mu> NU=<nu> VLEN=<vlen> ROUT='rt' AUTH='name' \
#    COMP='gcc' CFLAGS='flags' ALPHA=lst BETA=lst
# ID: Mandatory.  Unique (in this file only) int >= 0.
# STGID: Mandatory.  Number >0 matching and ID in storage.idx.  Predefined:
#    0: access major, scope TOBLKCBLK,VLEN,KVEC to determine what type
#    X: user defined type
# TOBLK: Mandatory.
#         0: copies from STGID block storage to column-major
#         1: copies from column-major to STGID block storage
# MU/NU: [0] unrolling along 1st & 2nd dim (MU=KU for A/B!);
# TRANS: [0] Needed only for A/B storage, indicates transpose being done:
#    0: cols of matrix stored contiguously, rows strided (col-major)
#    1: rows of matrix stored contiguously, cols strided (row-major)
# ALPHA: mandatory.  What alpha cases handled by kern.  For A/B, full list
#        is 1,N,X, for C it is 0,1,N,X.
# BETA: mandatory for C ignored for A/B.  Full list is 0,1,N,X.
#
# NOTE: for a storage format to be used by ATLAS, enough copy funcs must
#       be supplied for use, and the number required varies by whether the
#       format is for GEMM's A/B or C matrix:
#       A&B: TOBLK=1 and for real TRANS=N&T, cplx TRANS=N&T&C&H
#            TOBLK=0 must be present for testing & custom uses.
#       C  : TOBLK=0 required. TOBLK=1 needed for testing & custom uses.
#
# This routine doesn't work for non-aligned C, and perf not good enough to fix
